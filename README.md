# Build-a-Blog

This repository is essentially the skeleton for what would become the Blogz app (https://github.com/seanmstevens/blogz). It uses 
MySQL and Flask in order to display blog entries on a centralized blog list. 

A demo of the fully formed Blogz app is available at https://tinyblogio.herokuapp.com/.
